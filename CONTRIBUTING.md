## Code Style

We use `deno lint` for linting  
We use deno's LSP as base for code style.  

### Formatting Rules

```md
- Use camelCase for function names, variables, etc.
- Use PascalCase for class names.
- Returntypes on function eg. const example = (): void => {}
- Use semicolons where needed (deno LSP will say when they're not)
- Do not make unused variables or ununsed imports
- Double Quotes for strings
- Use all lowercase for filenames
```

## Submitting PR

When submitting PR, please make the title as simple as possible.  
Ex: `[Feature improvement]: Cache can now be loaded much faster`  
Also, please make it understandable for someone whose English is not a primary language.

Thanks!
